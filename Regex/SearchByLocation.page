                <h3>NORTH AMERICA</h3>
                <p>Step onto the NIKE, Inc. World Headquarters campus in Beaverton, Ore., and the brand’s energy and innovative drive are palpable. A diverse assembling of more than 8,500 employees push the limits in areas such as management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions. From a leading-edge <a href="http://about.nike.com/pages/nike-explore-team-sport-research-lab" target="_blank">sport research lab</a> and design facilities to renowned onsite childcare centers, Nike campus life reflects the company’s focus on employee growth and balance of work and play. Just minutes from downtown Portland, the lush, meticulously manicured grounds of the campus stretch across 270 acres and encompass more than 35 buildings — most displaying the names of legendary athletes such as John McEnroe, Mia Hamm and Nolan Ryan. The Nike campus circles the tranquil Lake Nike and features world-class amenities such as fitness centers, NIKE, Inc. retail stores, cafeterias and restaurants, dry-cleaning services, running trails, soccer fields, beach volleyball courts and much more. Historical displays and athlete memorabilia remind employees, athletes and guests of Nike’s rich history and heritage — as well as its potential.</p>
                <p>While Nike World Headquarters boasts the largest concentration of Nike employees in North America, the company has other corporate locations in cities such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the Toronto area and Fort Worth, Texas (home of Nike Golf’s research facility, <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/golf/the-oven" target="_blank">The Oven</a>).</p>
                <p>Several of Nike’s high-tech distribution centers operate in the U.S., with the majority of the facilities in Memphis, Tenn. Nike distribution employees ensure that millions of units of footwear, apparel and equipment arrive at the right destinations on time. And <a href="http://www.nikeihm.com/" target="_blank">Nike In-House Manufacturing</a> (IHM) manufactures and engineers plastics — including the iconic Nike Air bags — for NIKE, Inc. and other customers from their locations in Beaverton, Ore., and St. Louis, Mo.</p>
                <p>North America is also one of Nike’s hottest markets for retail, with more than 200 Nike Stores and Nike Factory Stores in the U.S. and Canada.</p>

Nike’s presence in the region spans decades: What was once a small Nike do Brasil subsidiary in 1990 is now one of the company’s most important markets, and Nike’s first operations in Argentina opened more than two decades ago. Today, more than 3,000 employees work in Brasil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Mexico.</p>
